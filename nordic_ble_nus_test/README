This project is an example of the Nordic UART Service (NUS) which includes configuration of the connection parameters:
- connection interval
- supervision timeout
- pheriperal latency
- preferred PHY
- MTU size
- Data length

This project consist of modifying Lesson 4 - Exercise 3 (Sending data between a UART and a Bluetooth LE connection by uding the Nordic UART Service (NUS)) by including all the concepts from Lesson 3 - Exercises 3-4. Current values assigned to the configuration parameters in prj.conf target a high throughput.  

The original code for Lesson 3, exercise 3,4 and Lesson 4 -exercise 3 are available at
